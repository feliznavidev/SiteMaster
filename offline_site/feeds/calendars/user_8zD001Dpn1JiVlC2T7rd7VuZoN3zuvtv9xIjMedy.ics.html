DESCRIPTION:The format for the study journal is provided below. This is va
 luable preparation for the tests\, and it is up to you to decide what is m
 ost important. Every key term must be filled out. Not every single categor
 y needs to be filled out\, and some key terms might not be perfect\, but a
  shown effort and attempt must be made on each term provided. \n\nKey Ter
 ms: Use the following format to help determine the most important informat
 ion for each term. You might find that you do not have any information to 
 complete each category or that you need to add a category. Entries must be
  single words or short phrases. You are not allowed to write full paragrap
 hs for any of the categories provided. \n\nWho: This seems pretty obvious
 \, but keep in mind that even when you are looking at something that might
  not have an obvious "who\," such as an event or piece of legislation\, th
 ere were people who organized it\, campaigned for it\, or voiced great opi
 nions against it. Who are they?\n\nWhat: Most often this will be the basic
  definition\, idea\, event\, or legislation.\n\nWhen: When did an event oc
 cur or a person live? What was the time frame? This might not be a date\, 
 for example\, a time frame might include westward expansion or World War I
 I.\n\nWhere: The US is vast. Where did an event occur or where was a movem
 ent most important? Did the significance of location change over time\, as
  it did during the Civil Rights Movement?\n\nSignificance: We don't have t
 ime to talk about insignificant things. The things I want you to know are 
 significant in our history. You might think of this as the "why." Why do I
  need to know this? What does it help me to understand?\n\nConnection: How
  does this term fit into the large picture? What else is it connected to? 
 Consider the chapter that the term is found in.\n\nTemplate (You can expan

 y needs to be filled out\, and some key terms might not be perfect\, but a
  shown effort and attempt must be made on each term provided. \n\nKey Ter
 ms: Use the following format to help determine the most important informat
 ion for each term. You might find that you do not have any information to 
 complete each category or that you need to add a category. Entries must be
  single words or short phrases. You are not allowed to write full paragrap
 hs for any of the categories provided. \n\nWho: This seems pretty obvious
 \, but keep in mind that even when you are looking at something that might
  not have an obvious "who\," such as an event or piece of legislation\, th
 ere were people who organized it\, campaigned for it\, or voiced great opi
 nions against it. Who are they?\n\nWhat: Most often this will be the basic
  definition\, idea\, event\, or legislation.\n\nWhen: When did an event oc
 cur or a person live? What was the time frame? This might not be a date\, 
 for example\, a time frame might include westward expansion or World War I
 I.\n\nWhere: The US is vast. Where did an event occur or where was a movem
 ent most important? Did the significance of location change over time\, as
  it did during the Civil Rights Movement?\n\nSignificance: We don't have t
 ime to talk about insignificant things. The things I want you to know are 
 significant in our history. You might think of this as the "why." Why do I
  need to know this? What does it help me to understand?\n\nConnection: How
  does this term fit into the large picture? What else is it connected to? 
 Consider the chapter that the term is found in.\n\nTemplate (You can expan

 complete each category or that you need to add a category. Entries must be
  single words or short phrases. You are not allowed to write full paragrap

 nions against it. Who are they?\n\nWhat: Most often this will be the basic
  definition\, idea\, event\, or legislation.\n\nWhen: When did an event oc
 cur or a person live? What was the time frame? This might not be a date\, 
 for example\, a time frame might include westward expansion or World War I
 I.\n\nWhere: The US is vast. Where did an event occur or where was a movem
 ent most important? Did the significance of location change over time\, as
  it did during the Civil Rights Movement?\n\nSignificance: We don't have t
 ime to talk about insignificant things. The things I want you to know are 
 significant in our history. You might think of this as the "why." Why do I
  need to know this? What does it help me to understand?\n\nConnection: How
  does this term fit into the large picture? What else is it connected to?
